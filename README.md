Happy counter is an app created to help the user achieve daily goals in a simple and stimulating way.

To achieve this, a cheerful, friendly and customizable interface was chosen with the belief that even actions that may seem unstimulating can become more challenging thanks to the use of tools considered pleasant.

With this simple counter you can monitor what you want thanks to the + and - buttons that will make the number increase or decrease, keeping track of the changes and it is possible to reset the number at any time with the reset button.

You can keep the counter with the starting options or you can customize it with additional functions: 

â€¢ A title that can indicate the category of your goal (books you want to read, glasses of water you should drink..)

â€¢ A goal, a number that will keep track of how much you have left to reach it and when you achieved it

â€¢ It is also possible to change the color of the buttons to make the counter more personal.
