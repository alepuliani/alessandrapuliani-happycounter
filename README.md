Happy counter is an app created to help the user achieve daily goals in a simple and stimulating way.

To achieve this, a _cheerful_, _friendly_ and _customizable_ interface was chosen with the belief that even actions that may seem unstimulating can become more challenging thanks to the use of tools considered pleasant.

## How it works

With this simple counter you can monitor what you want thanks to the **+** and **-** buttons that will make the number increase or decrease, keeping track of the changes and it is possible to reset the number at any time with the **reset** button.

## Additional functionalities

You can keep the counter with the starting options or you can customize it with additional functions: 

- A **title** that can indicate the category of your goal (books you want to read, glasses of water you should drink..)

- A **goal**, a number that will keep track of how much you have left to reach it and when you achieved it

- It is also possible to change the **color** of the buttons to make the counter more personal.
