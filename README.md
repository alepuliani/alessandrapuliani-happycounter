With this simple counter you can monitor what you want thanks to the + and - buttons that will make the number increase or decrease, keeping track of the changes and it is possible to reset the number at any time with the reset button.

You can leave the counter with the starting options or you can customise it with additional functions: 

â€¢ A title that can indicate the category (books you want to read, glasses of water you should drink..)

â€¢ A goal that will keep track of how much you have left to reach it and when we have achieved it

â€¢ It is also possible to change the color of the buttons to make the counter more personal.
